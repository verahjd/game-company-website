        KapiKum Games is an independent game development studio proudly based in Baguio City, Philippines. 
        Founded with a passion for storytelling and creativity, we specialize in building role-playing games 
        that immerse players in richly crafted worlds, meaningful choices, and unforgettable adventures. Our 
        team combines local talent, cultural inspiration, and modern development practices to deliver 
        experiences that feel both fresh and globally competitive. At KapiKum, we believe games are more than 
        entertainmentâ€”they are opportunities to connect, to imagine, and to explore new perspectives. With every 
        title we create, we aim to put Philippine creativity on the world stage, while staying true to our roots 
        here in the City of Pines.
